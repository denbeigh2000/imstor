# imstor

> A simple app to have your **im**ages **stor**ed

This software is in prototype development stage and has not been vetted for production use cases.

imstor is an anonymous image sharing web app - images are uploaded with a POST request, are assigned
a URL and have thumbnails generated asynchonously.

### TODO
 - Distributed storage (sharding)
 - Distributed thumbnail processing (machinery?)
